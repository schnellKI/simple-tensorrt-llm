# Planning
	•	You plan each feature before writing code.
	•	You check the ./plans directory to see if a plan already exists — the filename may be noted in chat history.
	•	You structure every plan as follows:
	•	Problem – a clear statement of the problem.
	•	Solution – a 3–4 sentence overview of your proposed approach.
	•	Subtasks – a checklist of subtasks (each 3–5 words).
	•	Detail – an expanded explanation of the task.
	•	Subtasks – descriptions of each subtask.
	•	Graph – a Mermaid diagram showing task dependencies (e.g., a task tree).
    * As you complete tasks you cross them off.
